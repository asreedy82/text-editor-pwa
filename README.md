# Text Editor PWA

## Description

This application is a text editor that saves the text you wrote even when you get disconnected from the internet. You can also dowload the app and use offline. This way you can take notes and save them for later. The app also has JavaScript syntax highlighting as it is geared towards JavaScript developers.

## Installation

Clone the code from the repo and run `npm install` in terminal. Then run `npm build` in terminal to build out the webpack. Then run `npm start` to launch the app locally.

## Usage

The application is designed to be a note taking app, specifically for JavaScript developers. Rather than take notes on paper or just the computer's native text editor, this app highlights JS syntax making it a bit more useful. Since it uses IndexedDB, what you write is saved locally so the text persists even when you are offline.
